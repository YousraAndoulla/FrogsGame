# Frogs Game

**Frogs Game** is a simple yet challenging puzzle game designed to help players practice problem-solving and planning skills. The objective is to swap the positions of frogs on opposite sides of a series of rocks. Initially, three frogs are on the left and three are on the right, with a single empty rock in the center. Using only allowed moves, the goal is to make the left frogs end up on the right side and the right frogs on the left.

## Game Description
The game is played by moving frogs between rocks, with each frog only allowed to move forward onto an empty rock or leap over one frog. The challenge is to think strategically and plan the moves carefully to reach the goal with as few moves as possible.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Move frogs by clicking, using logical steps to solve the puzzle.
- **Java and Java Swing**: Developed with Java for game logic and Java Swing for the user interface.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple design using Swing components makes it easy to play.
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows the number of moves made, encouraging players to optimize their solution.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core game logic and functions.
- **Java Swing**: Graphical interface for user interaction.
- **NetBeans IDE**: Development environment used to build and test the game.
- **XAMPP** (Optional): For managing any score data or game statistics in MySQL.
- **SQL** (Optional): Database interactions if you decide to store game scores.

## How to Play
1. Move each frog one rock at a time, aiming to switch the frogs on both sides.
2. Frogs can only jump over one frog or move to an adjacent empty rock.
3. The puzzle is solved when all left frogs are on the right and vice versa.

## ðŸ‘¥ Authors
The Frogs Game project was created by **Yousra Andoulla** and **Rahil Allali** during our bachelor's studies in Mathematics and Computer Science. With a shared interest in game development and problem-solving, we collaborated to design this puzzle game, allowing players to practice logical thinking and planning. We worked together on both the game mechanics and the interactive user interface, using Java and Java Swing to bring our concept to life.
